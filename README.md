# 🥘 SKVR – Immersive Training Simulator

Transforming workplace safety training with a **real-time interactive VR simulation**, the **Safe Kitchen VR Simulator** places learners inside a **lifelike restaurant-style kitchen** to experience hazards, safe practices, and proper responses **without real-world risks**.  

What if every trainee could **walk through a professional kitchen in VR**, guided by a **ChatGPT-powered safety assistant**, learning to **identify hazards, handle equipment responsibly, and respond to dangerous scenarios** in a safe environment?  
What if training could be **modular, gamified, and measurable**, with **quizzes** reinforcing knowledge and providing **real-time feedback** to learners and administrators?  

This project combines **Unity XR Toolkit**, **Blender 3D modeling**, and **AI-driven assistance** to deliver a **next-generation immersive training platform**.

## 🌍 Overview
The **Safe Kitchen VR Simulator** delivers **five structured training modules** (5–7 minutes each), balancing **immersion with comfort** for VR newcomers.  

Each module covers a **core area of kitchen safety**:  
1. Identifying Hazards  
2. Proper Handling of Knives & Equipment  
3. Responding to Spills, Burns & Hot Surfaces  
4. Safe Food Handling  
5. Safe Cleaning of Kitchen Equipment  

Learners navigate a **restaurant-style kitchen environment** built in **Blender**, imported into **Unity URP** for VR optimization.  

A **ChatGPT-based assistant bot** provides **real-time guidance**, ensuring learners stay on track.  
➡️ Each module ends with a **5-question quiz** to reinforce learning and measure effectiveness.
